## Associate of Science for Transfer in Mathematics

In June 2023, I reached a major milestone by earning my Associate of Science for Transfer (AS-T) degree in Mathematics from Foothill College. My curiosity and passion for math began early and grew significantly during my time at Foothill, preparing me for advanced studies at UCLA in Statistics and Data Science. I've also enjoyed tutoring mathematics, which continually fuels my enthusiasm for the subject and helps me share its value with others.
