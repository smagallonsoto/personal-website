## Native English Fluency

Achieved native-level proficiency, having primarily used English academically, professionally, and socially since early childhood.

## Advanced Spanish Proficiency

Spanish was my first language, spoken exclusively at home until preschool. I maintain strong fluency and confidently use it in both personal and professional contexts.

## Learning Portuguese

Currently pursuing proficiency in Portuguese through online courses, driven by a personal interest in expanding my linguistics.
