## B.A. **Statistics and Data Science**

I'm finishing up my Bachelor's in Statistics and Data Science, and I really enjoy turning complicated data into clear, useful insights---basically making sense of the numbers so they tell a meaningful story. I focus on building predictive models, uncovering useful patterns, and solving real business problems. My goal is to work closely with teams who see analytics as a way to drive real results, growth, and innovation.
